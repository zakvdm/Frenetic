SPRINT 1:
*********
DONE - Player Input:  
	Player should be able to move around screen, jump, and (possibly) aim with the mouse.

DONE - Basic Player physics: 
	Player collides with level, player motion applied by physics engine

DONE - Basic Level:  
	Level built up out of farseer Body objects. Player collides against level. Level is rendered.

DONE - Abstract Drawing Code:  
	Make ISpriteBatch, with methods Draw(.....), then make an XNASpriteBatch : ISpriteBatch, that just wraps SpriteBatch's Draw methods (the one we need for now) and takes a XNA SpriteBatch in its constructor. This way we can unit test all the IViews.

SPRINT 2: Started on 2/02/2009
******************************
DONE - 2 - As the player, when I move the camera follows me so I'm always at the centre of the screen
	Just calculates a simple transformation matrix (code already implemented). Needs to be given to every IView?

DONE - 5 - Move crosshair and click to print position

DONE - 3 - Can properly exit game

DONE - 5 - Resources (network sockets) properly disposed on exit 
2 - Can recreate a game session once you've exited a running game

DONE - 13 - As the client I can bring down the console and type in a command

13 - Client types in a message and this message is shown on the screen of all clients connected to the server.

******************************COMMITED UP TO HERE FOR SPRINT 2 (32 sp commited to -- 28 sp completed in about 6 weeks)

*******************************
SPRINT 3: Started on 21/03/2009
*******************************
DONE - 3 - Console lifetime is changed to match game lifetime (so console can be used during menus and settings are sustained through multiple sessions)
  DONE Console created as singleton service at top level
  DONE Solve the problem with instances of PlayerSettings, PhysicsSettings, etc.
  DONE Solve the problem with player textures... when do they get loaded?

DONE - 5 - Player settings are synchronized over the network (eg. I can change my player name/color via the console, and all clients in the current game "see" it)
  DONE - Figure out how to serialize PlayerSettings with Player
  DONE - Test to see that the synchronization works properly

CARRIED OVER FROM PREVIOUS SPRINT:
DONE - 2 - Can recreate a game session once you've exited a running game

CARRIED OVER FROM PREVIOUS SPRINT:
DONE - 13 - Client types in a message and this message is shown on the screen of all clients connected to the server.
  DONE - Message on console (i.e. whatever's not a command) is sent reliably to the server
  DONE - Server sends messages reliably to all clients
  DONE - Messages are written to the console with the client name

*****
BUGS:
DONE - When joining a network session and then exiting, the resources are properly disposed 
DONE - Players/objects are not visible if they are in the "black" areas
*****

DONE - 8 - Basic visibility (All areas not directly visible from the current player position are black)
DONE - 8 - Player settings are saved over multiple game sessions
DONE - 20 - As the player, I can click on the screen and fire a railgun at the point where I click.

5 - Keeps and distributes/shows scores
5 - Player death... DUM DUM DUM DUUUUH
*****
BUGS:
1) When server dies, connected client has to shutdown gracefully
2) When a client disconnects, we have to remove its associated physics objects (currently only removing it from PlayerView)
3) PlayerSettings must be syncronized over network (currently they're not even sent by ChatLogSender (which also needs to be renamed))
FIXED NetworkPlayerProcessor will have to also update the LocalClient state (like if the server sends new Health status, etc.)
4) Fix the bug where you kill yourself if you click inside yourself...
5) On the Client, the player scores aren't stored against the correct names
*****

DONE - 2 - Refactor Menu System: Change menu system to use same keyboard structure as game (this will allow the console to lock keyboard input during the menu stages)

DONE - 5 - Add some kind of logging framework (so we can start doing debug output, etc.)

3 - Create a system of console-executable commands (probably with an attribute similar to [Tweakable] -- [Runnable]?)

13 - I can bring down the console and type "connect 196.21.23.4" and connect to a game hosted somewhere on the internet.

ZAK - 13 - Network Code improvements:
  3 - Send InputState instead of Player object
  DONE - 3 - Group data into single sends (so send one message that contains all UnreliableInOrder data, one for all ReliableOutOfOrder, and so forth)
  DONE - 5 - Only send objects when they change (Including Shots) (and eventually only send the changed bits...)
  DONE - 2 - Make everything consistent (i.e. fix Shots and Chat messages)

ZAK - 13 - Client-side Prediction
  DONE - 3 - Initial Implementation
  3 - Track average round trip time
  3 - Better prediction/smoothing algorithm
  2 - Cleanup Autofac's creation of PhysicsComponents

40 - Games can be recorded and played back 
	STEP 1:
	We need to investigate what effect Farseer has on this... Apparently it's not deterministic. Way around this? Do player physics manually?
	STEP 2:
	Implementation: Records all input (what? network incoming messages and local input? (if client)). Records a periodic 'summary' of the game state.
	STEP 3:
	Run game simulation from recorded files (instead of live input). Confirm that the game state reaches the expected 'summary' states.

3 - Write chat messages to the screen (not just in console)

5 - Game can be run in fullscreen and windowed mode
13 - The game is resolution independent
20 - Particle system (Mercury)
40 - Item pickups
40 - Can load a level format
20 - Can load levels from menu
40 - Various level items (jump pads, teleporters, etc.)
40 - Can load arbitrarily shaped polygons from textures
8 - As the client, I can reconfigure my keys
40 - Player can use various techniques to move better/faster (trick jumping, strafe/circle jumping, wall/double jumping)
40 - Various other visibility obscuring techniques (everything "behind" the player is not visible, using motion blurs, fade in/out, soft edges, etc.)
100 - Player character is animated
40 - Can search for sessions, see information on each one, and join one
100 - On the client, player movement, etc. is predicted to make the game seem smoother during online play
100 - Players earn experience and can use this experience to modify their appearance
