Iteration 1 Tasks:
Player Input:  TERENCE
	Player should be able to move around screen, jump, and (possibly) aim with the mouse.

Player physics: DONE?
	Player collides with level, player motion applied by physics engine

Level:  ZAK
	Level built up out of farseer Body objects. Player collides against level. Level is rendered.

Abstract Drawing Code: 
	Make ISpriteBatch, with methods Draw(.....), then make an XNASpriteBatch : ISpriteBatch, that just wraps SpriteBatch's Draw methods (the one we need for now) and takes a XNA SpriteBatch in its constructor. This way we can unit test all the IViews.
